## Interactive RSE composition plotter

This is an interactive version of the plot provided by Frank LÃ¶ffler.

To run you need to install numpy, Dash, dash-bootstrap-components and plotly.

```bash 
pip install numpy dash plotly dash-bootstrap-components
python interactive_RSE_comp_plot.py
```

After running the file dash will tell you an ip address where you GUI will be displayed.
Should the port already be used please change the `dash_port` variable to a new number.

## Hosting

For hosting we package interactive_RSE_comp_plot.py into a Docker image.
We mount a fixed size ext4 formatted file and use it as a volume to store the submissions, to cap the maximum used disk space.

The mountable file, `submissions.volume`, and the mount point, `submissions`, are created by executing

```
sh create_volume.sh
```

which makes sure to not override an existing file.

We build the Docker image and run a container based on it by executing

```
sh build_and_start.sh
```

This will also rebuild and restart if applicable.

As it is configured right now, the services is reachable on port 9000 on the host.
